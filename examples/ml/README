### This is work-in-progress and does not work yet.

Small example using the Z3 ML bindings.
To build the example execute
   make examples
in the build directory.

It will create ml_example in the build directory,
which can be run in the build directory via 
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. ./ml_example
or
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. ./ml_example.byte
for the byte-code version.
